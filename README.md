**Day Nine / 30 days of React challenge / "Self Sevice Cafe" app**

A simple React.js app as a self service cafe ordering system, kinda like you find at McDonalds etc.

**Concepts Explored:**
- Handling more information and 'stuff' in general
- Splitting data into sections with .map() and keys
- Storing more data in state
- Simple equations in a React app

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
